To do:

Implement search

Add a splash page
Style splash page
Refactor update and create form to use a single react form
Add error handling for project form
Add error handling for rewards form
Add error handling for edit project form
Improve ReadMe.txt



Refactor pledges:
 * should refactor projects pledges array to use id instead, so I'm not tracking amounts in two places
 * then I can change number of "pledges" on show page to "backers"

Questions:
